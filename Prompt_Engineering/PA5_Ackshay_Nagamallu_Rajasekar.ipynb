        "You can change the configuration parameters of the `generate()` method to see a different output from the LLM. So far the only parameter that you have been setting was `max_new_tokens=50`, which defines the maximum number of tokens to generate. A convenient way of organizing the configuration parameters is to use `GenerationConfig` class. By setting the parameter `do_sample = True`, you can activate various decoding strategies which influence the next token from the probability distribution over the entire vocabulary. You can then adjust the outputs changing `temperature` and other parameters (such as `top_k` and `top_p`). A full list of available parameters can be found in the [Hugging Face Generation documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.29.1/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationConfig)."
